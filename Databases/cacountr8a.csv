The total number of people in (un)paid work decreased by 15% (from 7.8 to 6.5 million), while a large fraction of earners who remained in work lost their earnings..2. Inactivity also increased, by around 10%. .3. Transitions from paid to unpaid work (i.e. earner to non-earner) or from work to unemployment/ inactivity are the most likely channel of labour market changes during the period when the economy was hit the hardest by the pandemic..4. The largest decrease in the number of earners (formal and informal) is observed in the wholesale and retail trade sector, with a drop of 549,000 earners..5. The results for agriculture and fishing highlight the importance of data availability to capture accurately the labour market changes under the COVID-19 pandemic..6. The decrease was particularly important for formal self-employed workers, amounting to a 66% reduction (from US$466.3 to US$158.0) in mean monthly earnings, compared to a 5% reduction (from US$691.5 to US$655.7) for formal employees..7.

Indigenous people are also a group of those most vulnerable  to the COVID-19 pandemic due to worse social, economic and health conditions than non-Indigenous, which can increase the risk of the disease..5. Brazil has the third-largest prison population in the world, 773,000 prisoners. It is estimated that 80% of the prison population will be infected with the virus, of which 20% may need hospitalization and 10,000 (8%) may need an ICU bed..6.

Brazil may face difficulties in responding to other health problems, such as those related  to sexual health during the pandemic. Experience from past outbreaks indicates the need to pay attention to the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual health outcomes, both at immediate and long term..2. The social, racial and regional inequalities present in Brazil are revealing themselves in rates of infection and lethality, as well as in the possibilities of conforming  to quarantine and other preventive measures, and in access to intensive care health services..3. It is too early to know what the impact of the economic/social and health sector policies will have on in equalities in Colombia, however, a few factors that have not been directly addressed by recent policies could prove to be continuing challenges.",Not applicable,English,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Commentary,0,1

The pandemic reveals new trends: 1) towards internalization; 2) a change in the age pattern of those infected between June and August, with growth among children and the elderly and a decline among adults; 3) greater chance of infection among blacks and browns and reduction among indigenous peoples; and 4) growth in families among the poorest 20% of the population, with a prevalence more than twice that observed among the richest 20%..2. When the pandemic arrives in Brazil, it finds a country with 12.6 million unemployed. This dramatic number masks the condition of gender and racial inequality that affects women and black people. Among the unemployed, 64.8% are black and brown, as designated by the PNAD/IBGE, while those who are white correspond to 34.2%. Women make up the majority (64.7%) of the workforce and are also the majority among the jobless population — 53.8%. The unemployment rate among women was 13.1% against 9.2% among men. The level of employment of men was 65%, while that of women was 46.2%. Thus, black women make up the main unemployed, precarious and low-wage workforce, which reveals the structurally racist and patriarchal nature of Brazilian capitalism.3. The pandemic unquestionably revealed to the country and the world what the country insisted on hiding: the dismantling of social security and labor rights by successive fiscal adjustments left Brazil immensely vulnerable to the devastation of the accelerated contagion process. On the one hand, the Unified Health System (SUS), legally universal and decentralized, but which was already suffering from a lack of resources - the federal health budget had been frozen since 2015 at the level of 1.7% of GDP, which it was not reversed with the slight recomposition made by the “war budget” in health — it collapsed in the face of new, unknown and immeasurable demands of covid-19..4. The intense precariousness of working relationships and conditions brings about a universe of male and female workers (more than 100 million people or almost 50% of the population) who find themselves, overnight, without work, without any type of remuneration, without assistance benefits and unable to continue searching the streets for some kind of precarious activity (informal activities) that would ensure them a form of income and survival..5. While among the white population the number of deaths in São Paulo (until 31/7) was 115 per 100,000 inhabitants, among the black population it reached 175 per 100,000. Among black men, it reached 250 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants, while among white men it was 157 for every 100,000. Among black women, the number of deaths was 140 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, while among white women it was 85 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.","The timid, reticent and belated federal measures followed the same ultra-neoliberal policy already underway: scarce resources for health and emergency aid and trillions for banks and businessmen, as approved in the so-called “war budget” (EC no. 106/2020) , which instituted the “extraordinary fiscal, financial and contracting regime to face the national public calamity resulting from the pandemic”.","1. What can be seen is an accelerated and expanded process of assistance/assistentialism aimed at absolute pauperism, which differs immensely from the right to social assistance. The latter can and should make up a social security policy, based on stable work with universal and public rights, welfare and health..2. As a social right, “universal basic income” programs can complement or temporarily replace the loss of labor rights, but they will never have the capacity to reduce inequalities in access to socially produced wealth..3. The replacement of stable jobs with rights by clientelist “income transfer” assistance programs reveals the most brutal form of subsumption of labor to capital: in addition to keeping the working class out of work at a low cost, within the limits of survival, it also acts to lowering the value of wages transfers to the state almost all the costs of reproduction of the labor force, since it relieves capital, and creates an even more perennial cycle of reproduction of inequalities, as it prohibits the access of men and women to possibilities of work with rights.",It does not specify,Portuguese,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Narrative reflection,0,1

This PL, benefited by the work of migrant associations and immigrant reception entities, is based on the understanding that: The COVID-19 pandemic and its severe and lasting socioeconomic impacts tend to further deepen the exclusion and vulnerability of immigrants and refugees, especially those with irregular migratory status, face in Brazil. In addition to harming these people's living conditions, irregular migration threatens the effectiveness of public policies in the fight against the pandemic and the economic crisis in the country, and it is urgent that this Parliament take initiatives to remedy it. It is notorious that this pandemic has affected the most vulnerable populations in different ways around the world, and it is known that migrants and refugees have always been among the people facing the greatest challenges in accessing services and public policies. Still, according to the International Labor Organization, when they manage to find a job, immigrants mostly also face alarming informality and precarious work conditions.","1. Lack of official data on Covid-19 cases and deaths among international immigrants in Brazil. This scarcity, as we have seen, is an expression of a structural xenophobia, which conditions the invisibility of foreigners in hospital records and which is added to the structural racism itself, considering that race/color is not mandatory in these same records..2. The absence of such information, on the one hand, hinders the identification of the specificities of race/color and nationality, thus making it difficult to elaborate specific public policies for blacks, browns, blacks and immigrants, on the other This side generates mobilizations, both institutional and civil society itself, which are important and extremely necessary for social and labor interactions based on welcoming, decent work and the universality of rights in Brazil.3. The initiatives of civil society itself, especially those led by immigrants, have been of fundamental importance so that the strategies to confront Covid-19 in Brazil take into account the specificities of the migrant population..4.

Non-spatial modeling: To analyze the correlation between the RR and the selected independent variables, They used the RR value of each municipality located in the space–time clusters, from February 25, 2020, to July 20, 2020 (n = 3304). They evaluate the effect of socioeconomic variables and mortality rate on RR using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM).2. Spatial modeling: They applied the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test to identify the model with the strongest explanatory power for the variable Y. A spatial regression may capture some of the spatial effects that affect the behavior of the Y variable; if both models are significant, the best model should be selected according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)",-The GINI index.-The Brazilian Social Vulnerability Index (SVI),-Socioeconomic status,"1. Emerging space–time clusters of COVID-19 in Brazil from February 25 and June 07, 2020, with relative risk (RR) greater than 1: Figure 2 and Table 1 + Table 2 (3 states with RR >1).2. It detected nine emerging space–time clusters of COVID-19 with a RR>1, which occurred in all Brazilian regions (p<0.001) for this second period (147 days), while two more clusters were detected compared to the first period of analysis: Figure 3 and Table 3 and 4. .3. The results obtained through the GLM showed that there was a signifcant positive correlation between the predictor variables in relation to the relative risk at the level of the municipalities belonging to the nine emerging clusters. The GLM result showed that all variables have a statistically impact on the RR of the municipalities located in the clusters. For each one-unit increase in the GINI, For each one-unit increase in the GINI variable, the relative risk increases by 2.02, while the impact of SVI is 0.82, and mortality rate is 0.021.: Figure 4. .4. The results of the LM-Lag showed that all variables analyzed have a statistically signifcant efect for RR, except for the SVI: Table 9.5. According to the results of the model, the variables GINI and mortality rate have a signifcant efect (p<0.001) on the relative risk of municipalities within the clusters. The GINI variable has the greatest positive direct (1.280) and indirect (1.414) efects, resulting in a total efect of 2.695. This indicates an increase in the RR within the municipalities due to inequality, but mainly due to the role of spillovers from neighboring municipalities. The same pattern was also observed for the mortality rate for the direct (0.015), indirect (0.016), and total (0.032) efects. In the case of SVI, no signifcant efects were observed for RR: Table 10.",Preventive measures and targeted interventions to combat the pandemic in Brazil,"1. Therefore, this space–time approach to detect emerging clusters will allow decision-makers to identify statistically signifcant hotspots of COVID-19 cases..2.

Brazil has faced several problems with the secondary role of the local companies in the VSC. Ever since the first vaccines were approved by the national health agency, the volume of products being delivered in the country has been insufficient for speedy vaccination of the whole population..2. Brazil is one of the countries most affected by the pandemic. When the number of cases accelerated, the country faced a lack of beds in intensive care units in the majority of hospitals. To reduce the number of cases, the country needed an intense immunisation programme, but this was delayed due to government resistance and inefficiency in planning and procuring the amount of vaccines needed.There are two possible scenarios for the healthcare GVCs: .1. Global South actors will remain unimportant actors in GVCs. The concentration of product development and production will remain in the Global North. This case does not consider immunisation and healthcare services on a global scale, and prioritises vaccine and medical goods distribution in advanced economies. Current national policies reflecting this approach will increase regional inequalities and vulnerability..2. From the South will seek to upgrade their activities, thereby creating a more polycentric configuration, leading to GVCs with lower power concentration in terms of geographical location. Thus, vaccines and medical goods controlled by actors in the South will also be distributed to these countries as other examples of GVCs. A potential increase in the number of healthcare sources could lead to more balanced access to health in the world. This would result from increased innovation, production capacity and distribution in low- and middle-income countries, thereby expediting their recovery.",Covid-19 vaccine supply,"1.

In urban areas the greatest change was a decrease of the gap in the category of wage earners, with virtually no change of the gap in unpaid family workers. In rural areas, on the other hand, practically all gender gaps increased, in particular those among unpaid family workers and independent workers..9. Formal and informal employment decreased in about the same amount among men, while for women the reduction in informal employment was between 3 and 4 times greater than the reduction in formal employment..10.

Gradual economic reactivation worsened the gender gap in employment..2. Reason why women were less likely to recover compared to men is because of the pre-existing gendered nature of the labor market, where women are typically employed in more vulnerable kinds of employment compared to men and hence, it was more difcult or took longer for them to go back to work..3. Heads of households without a partner, who live in rural areas, are the group that has borne the greatest burden in dealing with the economic and social disruptions that accompany public health crises..4. Total or partial confnement demands that women dedicate more time to housework and caring for others, which hinders their reintegration into the labor market...5.

It is the large cities that concentrate the most significant occurrences of the COVID-19 outbreak, which, in turn, expand into their respective surroundings as social contacts and networks structure the organization of life in and between cities (see figure 1).2. The main sources of origin and expansion of the COVID-19 outbreak are located in the largest urban centers in the regions with the highest density of the technical-scientific-informational environment in the country (Southeast), in the Federal District (Brasilia) and in other urban centers that have relevant economic dynamics, interconnected by their respective airports. The same happens on the scale of the municipality of Recife..3. The epicenters of COVID-19 are territories whose technical-scientific-informational means are, therefore, denser, sheltering a large part of the city's dominant and middle classes, that is, people who, having access to the set of goods and services necessary for modern social life, introduced or became “active pioneers” in the spread of the virus in the city upon returning from their international travels..4. Living in slums or stilts, under precarious living conditions, overcrowded houses, informal work, without access to information technologies and with access only to already saturated and precarious public health services, the dominated classes are the least able to react to COVID-19 crisis that is common to everyone, but does not affect everyone in the same way.5. Overcrowding, in confined spaces with an insufficient number of rooms available for families with more than four people, prevents the necessary isolation in case a family member becomes infected with COVID-19. The risk of contamination for these people is very likely, as heads of households have to leave their homes every day in order to get some money to buy food.6. The deficiency in terms of coverage of internet services leaves these people unable to use their creativity in order to seek safe opportunities to obtain some form of income. Finally, the precariousness of public social health services makes it difficult to provide care and follow up on suspected cases of contamination by the above virus..7. The biggest victims of the new coronavirus, in the world and in Brazil, are the poor and black people, which was justified exactly by some of the reasons mentioned above",It is not mentioned in this article,"1. As Brazilian cities have strong territorial inequalities that persist in the historical period of national formation, despite COVID-19 reaching all social classes, the most impoverished classes are the most susceptible to the physical and economic consequences of the ongoing pandemic..2. Currently, this situation is even more aggravated due to the current political situation that deepens socio-territorial inequalities, increases the interest in privatizing essential public services and disrespects labor rights..3. The consequences of the aforementioned socio-territorial inequalities are, therefore, intrinsically related to the main purpose of neolbeira capitalism, which lies in the generation of wealth above all, which is why the territory is permanently used, predominantly, as an economic resource",It does not specify,Portuguese,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Narrative reflection,0,1

The black population has a higher prevalence of chronic cardiovascular comorbidities when compared to the white population, representing a risk factor for an aggravated condition of Covid-19.4. The black population still faces important barriers to access the health system, although it is the majority of the Brazilian population, it has less access to consultations and exams..5. The Covid-19 mortality rate among black people is always higher than among white people in the country.6. Among women in the pregnancy-puerperal period who died from Covid-19 in Brazil, more than 75% were black. Later, a study by Brazilian researchers showed that pregnant black women hospitalized with SARS by Covid-19 had a similar mean age and morbidity profile to white women, but they were admitted in worse conditions and had a higher rate of admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation and death.7. The Covid-19 pandemic has opened wide the attempts to make the impacts of racism invisible in the process of illness and death of the black population. In the absence of strategies to guarantee access to health care or in the absence of public policies to address the vulnerability of the black population to Covid-19, Brazil reproduces the genocide policy in force since the slavery period.","Five actions are proposed: recognition of the privileges of being white in a racialized society; the understanding of racism as a current practice that is maintained and reproduced in social relations; the understanding of race as a dynamic and variable social construction; assume and reproduce a racial grammar and vocabulary, perceiving naturalized oppressions in speeches and expressions; and the development of the ability to interpret situations, practices and codes in a racialized manner, in order to identify possible naturalizations of the reproduction of racism.","1.

National data have shown a higher prevalence of chronic and neglected diseases among the black population, as a result of the greater social and economic vulnerability to which they are exposed and less access to health services. .2. Blacks report worse self-rated health rates when compared to whites. Data from the National Health Survey (PNS) show that the black population has higher prevalences of hypertension (44.2%) and diabetes (12.7%), when compared to the white population (22.1% and 6.2%, respectively).3. Segregation creates adverse health conditions, as, historically, the places where most black people live are precarious, with inadequate housing in relation to structural conditions, without access to basic sanitation services, drinking water, health equipment, for example, health clinics, pharmacies, parks and recreational spaces, contributing to greater exposure to risk factors, in addition to high levels of violence, resulting in the accumulation of health problems.4. According to the racial map of Brazil, cities such as Porto Alegre (RS), Vitória (ES), São Paulo (SP), Belo Horizonte (MG) and Salvador (BA) are among the five most racially segregated cities in the country. Among them, São Paulo is considered the epicenter of the epidemic in the country..5. Racism also conditions the adoption of preventive measures for Covid-19, considering that social distancing is not a privilege for everyone, especially in Brazil, where black men and women represent the majority of informal workers, domestic, commercial, food, transport, storage and mail, which remained active even during the pandemic..6. For the black population, the pandemic scenario is associated with unequal conditions determined by structural and institutional racism, as it has less access to health services and is in greater proportion among vulnerable populations, who have experienced the absence of the State in their territories for centuries. .",It is not mentioned in this article,"1.

Low adherence to social distancing measures can be determined by social inequality because the distribution of health and disease in populations is not random, and is associated with social status, which in turn defines the people’s living and working conditions..4. Essential portions of the population that survive informal work find it difficult to adhere to distancing, as they need to supplement their income, although they are on a temporary income transfer program.

The highest mortality rate was observed in the district of Brás (192.3 deaths/100 000 inhabitants) and the lowest in Jardim Paulista (48.1 deaths/100 000 inhabitants).3. Stratified analysis examining racial disparities in mortality according to area-based measures of school attainment revealed that differences between Whites and Blacks were higher in areas with a better educational level..4. Among all indicators, the educational level was the one showing the most substantial disparity between the categories. .5. In the young/adult population, among those living in areas with the lowest percentage of the population with a university degree, mortality was four times higher compared with that in the most educated group (RR=4.02, 95% CI 3.42–4.72); in the elderly population, the same comparison denoted a 96% increased risk of death.",It is not mentioned in this article,"1. A positive gradient was found for all socio-economic indicators, i.e. increases in disparities denoted by less education, more household crowding, lower income and a higher concentration of subnormal areas were associated with higher mortality rates..2. A decrease in mortality over time was observed in all racial groups, but it started earlier among Whites and Asians..3. These finding of a higher percentage of deaths occurring in primary-care or isolated emergency-care units observed for Black and mixed populations may be related to barriers in healthcare access..4.

The formality variable also shows a positive and statistically significant relationship, which may be associated with the fact that in the cantons with the highest percentage of population that work in the formal sector of the economy, whether in private companies or public institutions or companies, there has been a requirement that determined number of employees returned to their jobs while the pandemic was still raging..5. When the percentage of the economically active population is concentrated in economic activities belonging to the secondary or tertiary sector, COVID-19 infections increase due to which are activities that take place in places where you have contact with a large number of people..6. Economic activities carried out in the primary sector of the economy indicate the presence of a negative and statistically significant relationship..7.

The results show the places with the greatest risk or vulnerability to the pandemic and mainly that the socio-spatial inequalities bear a direct relationship to the spread and case-fatality of COVID-19 on various regional and intraurban scales..2. Processes of metropolization facilitate the spread of the virus, since they are characterized by high population concentration and circulation, diversification of resources, infrastructure, commerce, services, fluidity, and regional, national, and international connections, in addition to the simultaneous production of poverty, shortages, and contradictions..3. Metropolises concentrate and reproduce inequalities through intensified processes of production of wealth and scarcity, polarizing and draining values, energies, and resources..4. There are also important differences in the pandemic between state capitals, metropolitan areas, and the hinterlands of Brazil. Brazil’s territory is highly diverse and unequal..5. This is further complexified the places’ degree of adherence to the neoliberal agenda, which further increases the vulnerability of living conditions, functioning of public systems, and the organization, distribution, and use of available resources..6. Considering the necessary supply of healthcare services, workers, and equipment to care for COVID-19 patients, publications point to major regional inequality in Brazil..7. In Brazil, certain places may be especially vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the metropolises and areas with consolidated urbanization. Second, the places marked by corporate uses with intense spoliation of the territory, modernizations, and selective investments linked to certain productive specializations. Third, places of conservation use and lands occupied by traditional populations..8. The denial of the pandemic’s seriousness and of its repercussions by a minority of the population and mainly by the Federal Executive Branch has jeopardized coordinated actions at the national level and the adoption of necessary measures. The meaning of responses to the pandemic at the national level has caused the extension and exacerbation in time and space of the health, economic, and social crises resulting from the pandemic..9. Plans and policies may not present the proper consistency or correspond to the country’s different realities, vulnerabilities, and geographic situations..10. The political variable is crucial to the directions the pandemic takes and cannot be totally grasped by models and projections of risk and vulnerability. This also highlights the importance of analyzing geographic situations as meaning and condition for action by all persons, companies, and governmental and nongovernmental institutions in the territory.","HELP: The COVID-19 Observatory in the Quilombos monitors nationwide data on the pandemic among members of the maroon communities, having been created by the.National Coordinating Body for Quilombola Black Rural Communities (Conaq) and the Socioenvironmental Institute (ISA). .Crisis cabinets were created in the favelas in Rio de Janeiro, for example in the Complexo do created by the Voice of the Communities, Women in Action in and the Straight Talk Collective..There are many such examples of action by the population, committees, fronts, and social movements in fighting the pandemic in Brazil. Such actions lend new meanings for people living in socially vulnerable places.","1. Socio-spatial inequalities and geographic situations relate to the degree of globalization and vulnerability for places and are conditioning factors for COVID-19 as well as for actions to fight the pandemic..2. The pandemic’s risks and problems are not only conditioned by poverty or lack of healthcare services, but above all by the unequal conditions of risk, protection, and care in all dimensions of life..3. Action strategies in the common sense, with solidarity and social protection, aimed at reducing vulnerabilities, show that overcoming the pandemic and its consequences depends fundamentally on the decision to confront the socio-spatial inequalities on multiple scales – local, regional, national, and global – and the understanding and knowledge of the conditions for action.",It does not specify,English,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Narrative reflection,0,0

The COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil shows that regions and populations are subjected to conditions of increased vulnerability to the risks of infection and death..2. During the pandemic, the risk of infection for nurse attendants is 97.3%, due to direct handling of patients’ bodies. The use of personal protective equipment is crucial for the worker’s protection, but the supply of personal protect equipment has been inadequate. Nursing is a mostly female and black professional class, working on frontline care of COVID-19 patients. As women, they also work a double workload..3. The association between frontline care of COVID-19 patients, precarious housing, and overload of household work increases both the probability of infection at home and the illness itself..4. The blackest territories of the city also suffer from the unequal distribution of ICU (intensive care unit) beds, 60% of which are located in the wealthier city center..5. Given the shortage of precise epidemiological data disaggregated for the favelas and the erratic state government agenda and insufficient response to COVID-19 in these neighborhoods, local collectives have launched their own initiatives, demonstrating the organizational power of local action in emergency situations..6. The proportions of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths were initially higher in whites than in blacks. However, over the course of the EWs, there was a reduction in the proportion of deaths and hospitalizations in whites, while they increased in the black population..7. This highlights the magnitude of the drop in hospitalizations and deaths in whites and the increase in blacks in just a few weeks, underscoring the trend in racial inequalities and the maintenance of the racialized political and social conditions affecting black lives..8. The number of deaths in blacks exceeds that in whites, even though hospitalization does not follow this trend..9. This emphasizes the black population’s difficulty in accessing health services, especially higher-complexity services such as intensive care beds, a critical resource in the current pandemic.",It is not mentioned in this article,"1. This unequal behavior of the disease between the white and black populations, with an unfavorable trend in the latter, corroborates the analyses on racial inequalities in Brazil, resulting from the country’s colonial background, which takes for granted the place destined to each person depending on their race, which is also a political construction..2. COVID-19’s impact on the black population is already visible in some spaces: the media, scientific debates, and certain government agendas. The problem’s visibility, pressured by black voices, mainly from the periphery, continues to be part of the antiracist struggle’s banner, raised especially by the black people.",It does not specify,English,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Narrative reflection,0,1

ICU admissions per ICU bed, the North had the highest rate of admissions (2246 per 1000 ICU beds), followed by the Southeast (2217 per 1000 ICU beds), Northeast (2073 per 1000 ICU beds)..10. 54% of patients were admitted to hospital in the state capitals, but this proportion was lower for the South (32%) and higher for the North (61%), Northeast (70%), and Central-West (71%) regions (table 1)..11. Patients that were admitted to the ICU and mechanically ventilated was similar across age groups in the North, but the proportion of patients admitted to the ICU was higher than those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the other regions.",It is not mentioned in this article.,"1. Existing regional heterogeneity of the health system, followed by the temporal spread of the epidemic, and disparities in adherence to best practices for clinical management of.severely ill patients, have contributed to the differences observed in mortality and resource use among the regions.2. The North and Northeast regions have the lowest number of hospital beds per person in Brazil. The difference is even more pronounced when analysing ICU beds: the Southeast had approximately two times more ICU beds per person than the North at the beginning of the pandemic in Brazil..3.

The reduction in mobility was not significant, but much worse for Amazonas, where the adhesion to social distancing was lower and mobility was reduced by only 20% in the studied period..2. Despite the sub-notification, the number of infected people is lower in Paraná (PR), which is the most populous of all analyzed states in this study. Also, PR is a neighbor of Sao Paulo, which is by far the state with the highest number of cases in Brazil.3. The minimum temperature is a risk factor only for PR, which has a subtropical  climate. These results suggest that minimum and maximum temperatures in this type of climate are a risk factor for cases of COVID-19..4. Socio-economic conditions (HDI) proved to be the most important risk factor among the states. This suggests a difficulty for people to understand the importance of hygiene measures and social distancing on the spread of COVID-19..5. HDI index indirectly measures the difficulty that people have to keep social distancing due to the daily need to search for resources for their livelihood. Therefore, income and education levels are the main relevant factors..6. Access to the health care system is another important factor related to socio-economic conditions that can also help explain the high number of deaths in Amazonas (AM), Ceará (CE), and Maranhao (MA), the states with less ICU available by inhabitant.7. Fraction of elderly, is also an important risk factor, as(...) because (...) The elderly are the most vulnerable group to COVID-19..8.

HDI showed statistical significance for COVID-19 and Influenza, and Amazonas was the state with the highest significance for this variable (see the p-value in Table S3). HDI and the elderly are important factors for COVID-19 cases, while the elderly fraction is remarkably the main factor for Influenza in the set of variables and states.","The president’s speech against the WHO recommendations forced the Federal Court of Justice to determine (on April 08) that the competence to adopt or to maintain measures during the COVID-19 pandemic should be shared between the three levels of government: federal, state and municipal administrations.

COVID-19 arrived in unfavorable periods and atypical meteorological conditions for PR state(drier and sunnier conditions + solar radiation) that contributed to the control of COVID-19 spread in the state..3.

Several regions of the city have homes inhabited by the elderly (over 60 years), the population being more vulnerable to the virus and more likely to develop the most severe symptoms of the disease..2. Residents who do not have access to a bathroom or toilet, or whose sewage discharge is carried out in the open, are more likely to acquire the disease and transmit it to their families..3. The variable proximity to a bus terminal (TERM) reflects a greater probability of the existence of agglomerations between infected people and residents of the region. Despite the measures of social distancing, the reduction in the vehicle fleet tends to result in overloading the bus terminals..4. The terminals are located in the most socially vulnerable areas of the city, where a large part of the subnormal agglomerates are concentrated, where public services are insufficient and the infrastructure of residences is inadequate..5. Figure 3 allows us to visualize the socioeconomic discrepancies between the different regions of the city.6.

An analysis of the numbers of cases verified by neighborhood also highlights the considerably higher response capacity in upscale neighborhoods, which, despite the alarming number of confirmed cases, have a lower number of deaths, unlike peripheral neighborhoods with lower infrastructure conditions. Thus, vulnerability shows a close relationship with the precarious conditions to which the various regions of the municipality are subjected",It is not mentioned in this article,"1. The evolution of the COVID-19 contagion rate in the city of Fortaleza shows that, at first, neighborhoods with the highest per capita income in the city had higher numbers of confirmed cases, due to the return of people from countries where they already there was sustained contamination of the disease..2. However, it was not long before the contagion rate increased in poorer regions. At the moment, the number of infections is decreasing in areas with the highest Human development Index and there is already a sustained spread of the virus in all neighborhoods of the city..3.

The unemployment gap has increased dramatically. .2. For the April-June 2019 quarter, the unemployment gap stood at -4.95%, while for the same period of 2020 this indicator increased to -7.25%, for a difference of 2.3 percentage points. (see Figure 1).3. The job the male recovers faster than the female, or the impact of the COVID-19 in the medium term has more profound impacts for women..4. The rate of occupancy was reduced in all periods compared to 2019, the largest reduction it occurred in the April-June quarter when it went from 46.04% in 2019 to 33.1% in 2020. The occupancy gap between 2019 and 2020 has registered slight decreases, without However, women continue to participate less in the labor market..5. Average hourly pay for employees salaried workers is slightly higher for the female population in the three months analyzed. For January and February, it is observed that women earn in average 2.8% and 4.6% more than its counterpart. In June, times of COVID-19, it is possible to perceive a decrease in the average salary of the female population, achieving a difference of only 0.15% between both genders (June)..6. Wage gaps widen in the lowest income groups, with women being the most affected. For the higher income groups, there is not a very clear trend..7. Regarding the average income, a decrease can be observed in the female versus male wages in both February and June..8. The activities where more pay equity is shown by gender are the employees of government and private company; even in these two cases, the female population it enjoys a slightly higher average remuneration than its counterpart. .9. In self-employed workers, a wage gap of 18.5% in favor of men. Regarding domestic work, an activity that has been historically feminized, the gaps amount to 26.6%, with women being with lower salary. (see Figure 4).10. A trend is evident growing in the amount of inactive population, this trend is shared by both in men as in women, the latter being the ones with the highest inactivity figures..11. For 2019, the average inactivity rate for women was 11.1 pps more higher than that of men, while by 2020, this difference increased at 11.8 pps, which shows the macroeconomic shock caused by COVID-19. (see Figure 6).12. The reasons for the greater increase in inactivity of women in compared to men are associated with increased care domestic work and unpaid work resulting from confinement, closure of schools and nurseries, which has placed the responsibilities of the home on women..13. Both before and after the pandemic, 98% of the people who left their work because of “family responsibilities” were women, a finding confirming the overload of domestic work and care within the home for the female population. (see Figure 7 and 8).14. Only two sectors registered positive variations: financial activities and insurance and real estate activities. The sectors with the greatest amount of female labor have been the most affected by COVID-19, consequently, production has been reduced, leading to business closures and job losses for a large number of women in the labor market.

Social distancing due to the covid-19 pandemic can generate challenging and dangerous situations for LGBTI+ people, especially for those who are homeless and/or unemployed and, therefore, need to return to their relatives. In these circumstances, these people may suffer some type of violence while sheltering in the home of LGBTIphobic relatives, in which respondents reported being more likely to suffer violence and abuse by relatives, given the need for shelter during quarantine.3. These contexts of emotional suffering are produced from lack of family support, difficulty in accessing health services, the stereotype and stigma that permeate the relationships and experiences of LGBTI+ people and insufficient work opportunities. During the covid-19 pandemic, prevention strategies, such as social distancing, can intensify these problems and, consequently, emotional distress..4.

First it could strengthen multisectoral approaches such as the COVAX global collaboration in order to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. .3. An effective global initiative could support the creation and funding of a Global Intellectual Property Repository, to accelerate the assemble and deployment of existing and newly established intellectual property in relevant pharmaceutical molecules, diagnostics, health data, software, 3D printing codes etc..4.

Brazilians are particularly prone to believe on the information they receive through any communication media. Unfortunately fake news spreads 70% faster than real news even in traditional media. .4. The most effective reforms will come about through concerted intergovernmental cooperation, not isolationist measures: a view of the state as responsive and aware of its responsibilities accordingly to the theory of vulnerability..5.

Chile: alternating total confinement and by regions, predominantly considering the biological risk and not social vulnerabilities. Socio-spatial inequities and conditions of housing, and use of military troops to night curfew emphasize intervention with low social participation in making decisions..3. Argentina: decreed social confinement mandatory horizontal at the national level (agreed with the different ministries in an intersectoral manner) and with additional resolution of income transfer for pensioners and beneficiaries of social programs.

Although most survey participants reported that the pandemic negatively impacted their academic work routines, the results for those most affected varied according to the social profiles of gender and race. Self-declared black, brown, yellow and indigenous people, grouped in the non-white category, are the ones who most indicated the option “very negatively” to qualify the consequences of covid-19..2. 29% of men and women report negative impacts of covid-19 on their professional lives. Among the small portion that declared positive consequences, in turn, this group was also more recurrent, with 10% for both men and women..3. In terms of academic career stages: in all cases the perception that the pandemic was negative for work routines is dominant. There is, however, a slight oscillation in the frequency of those who considered the impacts “very negative”. This option was more recurrent among graduate students, with 36% of the responses from masters and 25% of the choices from doctoral students.4. Covid-19 and social isolation affected the work of social scientists, in the first place, due to the increase in time spent taking care of the home and/or family members (61%). The disorganization in the routine caused by the pandemic was demarcated as an obstacle to meeting deadlines by 44% of the interviewees and also generated uncertainty about the future for 38%. In addition to an increase in domestic tasks, an increase in the demand for academic (35%) and administrative (24%) work was reported..5. Women have their work routines significantly more affected by the pandemic and perceive an increase in academic demands more intensely than white men. White women, in turn, report feeling more the effects of covid-19 in relation to care issues than non-white women, although the difference between them is small..6. Anthropology was the most affected discipline, with 79% of researchers indicating that they had problems continuing their research, followed by other areas (61%), sociology (58%), political science (38%) and international relations (21%)..7. Non-white women have lower proportions of productivity than the other groups (32%), while white men have the highest levels of production (42%).8. Submission of articles by respondents who have children was 41%, and by people without children, 36%. On the other hand, among people who have children, 33% said they had not produced anything in the period, while respondents with children indicated a higher percentage, 37%..9. In the group of teachers, 73.8% indicated an increase in housework, which rises to 80.5% in the case of teachers who take care of children.10. White and non-white women indicate more time spent on care activities than men, and inequality is significant.11. A little more than 20% stated that they “are better concentrated at home” and/or that “the structure of my house is better for working”. More than 30% stated that they save transit time and therefore can work harder. Men report more than women that working at home during the pandemic is good, as it allows them to spend more time with their children.",It is not mentioned in this article,"1. As consequences of the recent crisis, they tend to reverberate differently, with areas such as anthropology being more harmed in terms of conducting their traditional research methods; women, especially black, more overloaded with work routines, and white men maintaining advantages in professional development, even declaring losses in this crisis scenario..2. An academic community as a whole reported an increase in job demands. Contrary to what might be expected, teachers continued to have high productivity rates. This is likely to lead to fatigue and challenges to mental health, especially in groups that have less access to leisure activities and are overloaded with care functions and household chores..3.

Studies conducted thus far highlight that gender inequality may be exacerbated by austerity measures/policies since they worsen women’s labour-family life balance and render them more vulnerable to recession due to being predominantly engaged in part-time, temporary jobs, informal work, and self-employment, as well as accentuating inequalities between women..2. Women are also more vulnerable to gender-based violence when welfare provisions and entitlements impact women's equality, safety and financial autonomy..3. In Brazil, public policy responses during the Covid-19 crisis have been severely lacking and have not specifically considered its gendered effects, indicating a significant shortfall.","1. Emergency Benefit. This benefit consisted of R$600 per month bestowed on individuals with informal jobs, monthly/annual incomes below a defined threshold and was limited to two people per household.

In the moment we live the virus itself does not discriminate, but inequalities are operated in our society in the historical process that has intertwined nationalism with poverty, racism, xenophobia and capitalism, so that this dynamic promotes an accentuation of the spurious distinction between lives that are susceptible and not susceptible to mourning, where the production of precariousness elects those forms of life that are protected against death and those whose lives are considered not worth enough to be safeguarded against sickness and death.2. From this perspective, also concerned with the health of the LGBTI+ population in this scenario, the Brazilian Association of Collective Health (Abrasco) published a note with considerations that call for the breaking of silence and invisibility destined by several agencies and institutions, such as the State and civil society, to guide the subject as an essential agenda in public health in Brazil and in the rest of the world..3. It is important to emphasize that virtual meeting platforms under the perspective of users have been part in a more vehement way of the daily life of people who make use of these devices. In this aspect, if the moment calls for distance and social isolation, physical encounters occasioned by means of these platforms can put the health of their users at risk, constituting another aspect to be observed..4. Another factor that increases the harms to the lives of LGBTI+ people in Brazil during the pandemic are the daily attacks generated by presidential representation on the rights of this population segment, in spite of the constant potential for generating stress on the wellbeing of people who live with the violation of basic human rights, as well as the negative, obscurantist, reactionary, LGBT-phobic and delegitimizing position of the existence(s) of LGBTI+ people just as Brazil has been internationally recognized.",It is not mentioned in this article,"1.

What is observed is a growing number of people who will die for lack of material and financial resources to fight Covid-19. At first, the doctrine points out that the miserable, premature and avoidable death would be called mythanasia. From this perspective, although the lack of respirators may represent one of the biggest causes of death in the context of Covid-19, this would not be a situation of mythanasia, as its extraordinary nature and abrupt demand are not predictable situations, despite the effects of the pandemic may be compounded by human actions or omissions..2. Considering the exclusively age criterion, especially in the case of Covid-19, is to enable a denial of the right to health, especially due to the greater risk for the elderly who, as a rule, also have comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension.3. In extreme situations, using an ICU admission age criterion to save resources for those with greater probability of survival and longer life expectancy, as these elderly people would be mere resource consumers..4. The proposal to restrict access to health care for the elderly under the argument that they have already completed the life cycle or that they will not generate social return as a young person, in addition to being fallacious, is based on a supposed utilitarianism that is not necessarily correlated with age, since there is an intrinsic paradox to this supposed correlation, as a lower life expectancy does not mean that the elderly person has “less to contribute”. Many of the greatest minds of our time are elderly people. If we think in a utilitarian way and under the argument of social return, younger people would benefit at the expense of such people.","Some private hospitals, such as Albert Einstein and Sírio Libanês, both located in the city of São Paulo, have published their protocols and age is not an exclusion factor. Specifically in relation to the document published by the Hospital Albert Einstein, age is a factor taken into account only to compare the patient with the expected situation for people of their age, through the assessment of frailty, physical and clinical condition of the patient. In this way, the age criterion becomes fair, as it does not compare subjects in different conditions, but the subject with his own age group, thus effecting a treatment..The Regional Council of Medicine of Paraná (CRM/PR), on the other hand, stated that it is up to the Bioethics Commission or the Crisis Management Committee to set the criteria for allocation of resources and, in their absence, to the doctor himself, including choosing for using the order of arrival criterion.","1. The pandemic required public authorities and society to reflect on the ethical criteria for allocating scarce resources..2. It fell to some private entities and, in a decentralized manner, to some Regional Councils of Medicine, in view of the state vacuum, issue resource allocation protocols. This action presents two insecurities: creation of multiple parallel protocols and a private invocation of content..3. The existence of multiple protocols may generate individual decisions to seek Institutions or States that value a certain allocation criterion, creating, on the part of the patient, the search for the subsumption of their staff to the health unit that does not place them at an excessive disadvantage or in a potential advantage..4. The decision to allocate scarce resources has always been inherent in the reality of managers, especially in peripheral countries and was only evidenced and exponentialized in the pandemic, which also highlighted the need for allocation criteria to be widely debated and avoided criteria that exclude specific groups, such as age criteria, under penalty of representing eugenic practices to eliminate the most vulnerable population..5. Despite being a tragic choice and one that entails an opportunity cost, the elderly cannot be sacrificed so that the younger ones have the means to try to survive. The current pretense of ageism practice of denying the elderly access to health care, in addition to being discriminatory, can translate into a death sentence, as access is denied to the means known by current science to fight Covid-19..6. Finally, it is necessary to extrapolate the legal argument and defend that the neglect of the elderly at that time constitutes a true disregard for the future of Humanity, because, by assuming that the young will have preference, it is, in fact, opening a dangerous precedent for future societies to be able to ignore the old age that will be represented by all contemporaries of this pandemic, after all, if today the world is fighting Covid-19 it is precisely so that everyone is able to live longer.",It does not specify,Portuguese,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Narrative reflection,0,0

A model of economic inequality, income concentration and growing poor population exists, increasingly concentrated in urban areas and their peripheries, in precarious living conditions and the weakening of institutions and capacities of global governance to deal with disasters and pandemics that require coordinated policies and actions have intensified social inequalities and income concentration resulting in a large vulnerable population with precarious living, working and income conditions..2. The vulnerable population is the most dependent on the actions carried out by universal health systems, such as the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), healthcare for groups at higher risk of COVID-19, such as the elderly, people with chronic diseases (diabetic, hypertensive, cardiac insufficiency, renal or chronic respiratory disease)..3. The health sector plays a key leadership role in the risk management of a pandemic, a process that includes and depends on the participation of the civil society (NGOs, residents' associations, local movements such as the ones in favelas and indigenous communities, among others) and other government sectors relevant to response (Civil Defense, economy, education, transportation, water and sanitation, environment, social protection, agriculture, among others)..4.

In Manaus and São Paulo, there was a number of deaths from natural deaths about 3% and 2% higher than in the civil registry, respectively. In Fortaleza, this difference was less than 0.5% and in Rio de Janeiro the number of deaths was 1% higher in the Mortality Information System.2. Between February 23 and June 13, 2020, 74,656 natural deaths were recorded, 32,338 in São Paulo, 26,236 in Rio de Janeiro, 9,784 in Fortaleza and 6,298 in Manaus..3. Based on the predicted values for 2020, 51,422 deaths would be expected, resulting in an excess of deaths of 45% (95%CI: 44-47).

The excess of deaths, in relative terms, was similar between the age groups, except for São Paulo, and significantly higher in males, regardless of the city (Table 1)..5. It is noteworthy that the excess of deaths was lower in Epidemiological Weeks (SE) 9-12 in all cities, with the exception of São Paulo, where observed deaths exceed by 11% (95%CI: 7-15) the expected deaths , probably because of the higher mortality among men aged 20 to 59 years..6.

Blacks (blacks and browns) account for 56.4% of the Brazilian population, and black women constitute the most vulnerable group. They account for 28% of this population, but they are over-represented in poverty, corresponding to 32.8%, and 9.1% of Brazilians live in extreme poverty.2. At the onset of the pandemic, data on cases of virus infection and disease deaths were released without color/race specification..3. The federal government's failure to provide guidance to federation entities has resulted in little collection and insufficient processing of statistics on race/color and gender, as shown by the survey, carried out in April 2021, in epidemiological bulletins published in all 26 states of the federation and in the Federal District..4. Most states (17) do not disclose information on ethnic-racial membership in the daily epidemiological bulletins. .5. If these data are disaggregated by region, we have the South as the most silent in this regard, since none of its three states bring statistics. On the opposite side appears the North Region, where four of the six states present race in the data communication. In the Northeast, only three of the nine states do so; in the Southeast, two states..6. In June 2020, it can be seen that the number of states that started to incorporate race in the collection and dissemination of data on Covid-19 has doubled. From five in 2020, it became 10 states in the following year..7. When looking at the collection of data disaggregated by gender and ethnic-racial membership, we have 15% of the states that disclose this information, that is, only four of the 27 units of the federation. They are: Amazonas, Acre, Roraima and Espírito Santo. As well as in the production of statistics on color/race, the North Region also appears in data collection by sex as the most representative, as three out of six states in the region specify them..8. It is important to highlight how blacks and black women figured as the first people to be immunized in most states. In three states (São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santos), the strategy adopted places the governors, white men, alongside black women.",It is not mentioned in this article,"1.

By the end of May 2020, the total employed population had already decreased by around 7 million people, compared to the same period of the previous year, and, in the accumulated result for the year up to this period, there was already a negative balance of more 1.1 million formal jobs..2. The estimated unemployment rate rose from 11.8% to 12.8% between February and May 2020, and was only not higher due to the substantial drop in the labor force participation rate (from 62% to 56%) in the same period, mainly due to the portion of the population without a job that stopped seeking relocation due to the necessary measures of sanitary prevention..3. Estimates point to an absolute fall in employment of around 9.9 million between February and May 2020, in addition to an increase in the depressed population (+1.2 million) and a drop in those employed with social security contributions (-3.3 millions). As a result, the mass of income effectively received decreased by R$37 billion, down 16.5%..4. The first data from PNAD Covid-19 already indicated that 5.2% of Brazilian households (about 3.5 million) survived in the month of May only with the income received from emergency aid from the federal government, moving the following month to 6.5%, 4.5 million households.5. Practically all economic sectors registered a decline in employment compared to the same period of the previous year, with the most affected being: commerce, civil construction, food and accommodation, in addition to the category of domestic services, strongly marked by informal ties ..6. The only sectors that did not suffer a retraction were: agriculture, services for companies (information, communication and financial, real estate, professional and administrative activities) and public administration.7. According to data from PNAD Covid-19, people who declared themselves black and brown corresponded, in June 2020, to 54.9% of the workforce,3 being 52.5% of the employed4 and 60.3% of the unemployed this month of reference. During the first months of the pandemic in the country, the unemployment rate grew for all groups of color or race, with a general average going from 10.7% to 13.1% between May and July. Considering only the black population – men and women – this increase was even higher: it went from 10.7% and 13.8% to, respectively, 12.7% and 17.6% (Table 1)..8. The effects of these measures on economic activity led several companies to reduce their productive activities, or even close them, reducing the demand for work or even taking advantage of government initiatives to temporarily suspend employment contracts..9. the black population, which corresponded to 52.3% of the employed, represented 58.4% of those temporarily on leave in May. This overrepresentation is also verified in the following months. The distancing was more intense for the group of black women. Despite corresponding to 21.5% of the total employed, they represented 30.9% of people temporarily away from work. As shown in table 2, although the percentage of absences decreased in the following months, the group of black women, in particular, remained as the most affected by absence from work..10. Occupations with weaker ties were the most affected by social distancing. While employees without a formal contract in the private sector and self-employed accounted for 9.6% and 29.0% of those employed, they were, respectively, 11.8% and 35.0% of those on leave due to social distance..11. Black women workers were the ones who had the greatest reduction in working hours, with consequent repercussions on earnings, the data also show that, even among professionals with higher education, black women were the only ones who spent less than a workload. 70% of usual. (Graphic 1).12. More than 8.7 million workers continued to work remotely, corresponding to 10.3% of those employed in May, with a reduction in this rate in the following months. Remote work was the reality for 17.6% of employed (not on leave) whites and for only 9% of blacks in this situation (Table 3). Only about a third of the total number of workers employed in remote activities were black workers..13. As shown in table 4, in July, 36.9% of the population over 14 years old out of the labor force (inactive), about 28 million people, was in a situation of discouragement. Of this set, about two thirds (65.3%) corresponded to black individuals. It is noteworthy that 67.0% of the total discouraged attribute this condition to the pandemic, which we call in this text discouraged by the pandemic.",It is not mentioned in this article,"1. The multiple and intersectional inequalities that weigh on the black population have been intense and aggravated during this time of pandemic..2. In addition to paying attention to the direct effects of health conditions and access to medical care, the prospects for subsistence and labor insertion are essential to, at least, not allow for the expansion of racial inequalities, which are so striking and structuring in the country..3. They formed the vast majority of the labor capacity subject to the situation of hidden unemployment due to despondency, largely justified by the impossibility of seeking employment during the pandemic..4. In the absence (or insufficiency) of social safety nets, the horizon becomes more than worrisome..5. In addition to policies to guarantee employment and encourage productive activity, especially in labor-intensive sectors, the expansion and strengthening of social and labor protection networks are fundamental measures in order to prevent the current effects of the crisis lead to the intensification of the already expressive level of racial inequality existing in the labor market",It does not specify,Portuguese,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Review,0,1

The Southeast Region concentrates (51.9%) of the national ICU beds, while the North (5.2%) and Central-West (8.5%) regions do not reach 10% of the total beds..2. There was a jump in the number of beds in the country, from 46,045 in December 2019 (pre-pandemic moment) to 60,265 (post-pandemic) in April 2020. In other words, in approximately four months, there was an increase in 14,220 beds, which represents a total increase of 23.59%, and which is quite significant..3. 3,104 are from the Health Unic System, that is, available to the entire population, including those with a private health plan. This timid advance of the Health Unic System represents only 21.82% of new ICU beds..4. With its growth, the private sector managed to install over 11,116 beds, which represented 78.18% of new intensive care beds across the country, expressing unprecedented inequality in the recent history of the country, that is, since the implementation of the Health Unic System ..5. With the pandemic, the numbers were very inverted and the country had an offer of 26,153 public beds compared to 34,112 private ICU beds, resulting in a difference of 7,959, very different from the old 53 beds, the largest in the public sector..6. A country in which only 22.41% of the population has a private plan, representing a total of 47,084,565 people, and the other 77.59% (or 163,062,560 people) depend exclusively on the SUS..7. In the North Region (8.77% of the national population), 90.72% are exclusively dependent on the Health Unic System, and they dispute 1,793 SUS ICU beds, which means that there is approximately one SUS bed for every 9,325 people. Also in this region, it can be seen that 9.28% of the population have health insurance and dispute 1,335 beds, resulting in an approximate proportion of one bed for every 1,281 people..8. In the Northeast Region, (27.15% of the country's population). Of these, 88.43% depend solely on the SUS, competing for 5,968 beds, making up the approximate proportion of one bed for every 8,456 people. As for the beneficiaries of health plans, it is noted that they are 11.57% of the population in this region competing for 6,512 ICU beds, which results in approximately the proportion of one bed for every 1,013 people.",It is not mentioned in this article,"1. Public regulation of beds (single-line) seems to be a measure of justice that urgently needs to be implemented, unless it is validated, once again, that some lives are more important than others.2. Regional differences in bed supply, rather than being an argument against bed unification, is actually an argument in favor.3. 77.59% of the Brazilian population depends exclusively on the SUS, but they only have 26,153 beds spread across the country, while the situation of beneficiaries of health plans is absurdly more comfortable (in relation to the supply of ICU beds, it is clear).4. Despite a little more than three quarters of the population being dependent on Health Unic System, the great expansion of intensive beds occurred in the private sector, making up, until April 2020, 78.18% of the national growth, while the increase of SUS beds resulted in a timid 21.82% of the total growth..5. This, in turn, contrasts with the desires and speeches of sanitarists, that the Health Unic System is getting stronger in the pandemic, which certainly occurs within the scope of society's perception, but from the concrete point of view, of improvements in the system, as the expansion of the ICUs, an exponential growth of the supplementary sector can be seen.",It does not specify,Portuguese,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Review,0,0

The first group contains people of low social origins or belonging to the working class (Their jobs do not allow them to work from home; this is the group that performs the most essential services). The second group comprises the typical Argentinian middle class. The third group is made up mainly of the upper-middle class..2. Everybody is confined (to the extent that it is mandatory), but not everybody is confined under the same conditions..3. Seven large groups of secondary and experiential risks produced by the confinement have been identified in the analysis: .a. The first group is comprised of subjective or emotional risks. The second group comprises what I have identified as temporal risks (social jet lag), namely, sensations and perceptions linked to the loss of social orientation of time during the lockdown. The third group is that of material risks, that is, the material or socioeconomic effects of the lockdown.The fourth group is comprised of health risks, those directly linked to the physical health of confined people, as well as the subjective probabilities of getting infected or being hospitalised. The fifth group is formed by the so-called voluntary risks (They are perceptions that relate confinement to willingness).The sixth group is about moral and normative risks, related to the collective duty of.complying with the confinement. the seventh group is comprised of symbolic and political risks.4. Subjective/emotional and health risks are mainly associated with women, salaried employees who are able to work from home during confinement (but without separate rooms to do so) and middle-class individuals who live in apartments and are between 30 and 49 years old..5. The symbolic/political, temporal and material risks are mainly associated with people between 50 and 69 years old, who have private health insurance, belong to the upper-middle or upper class, are part of nuclear families and are mainly men..6. Voluntary and moral/normative risks are associated with the working and lower classes, between 18 and 29 years old, who do not have access to social security, work in essential jobs and live in extended households..7. The middle and upper classes have increased their cultural consumption during the lockdown (movies, plays, and even operas using digital platforms).While , the cultural consumption of the lower classes has declined..8. Those of a higher social class increased their participation in workshops and online courses (cooking, arts, yoga); the lower classes decreased their participation..9. The ‘family climate’ varies according to socioeconomic status: whereas the upper classes were found to have a very good climate during the quarantine, among the lower classes (where unemployment and overcrowding are higher), family climate was more conflictive..10. Most distinctively upper-class behaviours are associated with men. Women, by contrast, shop less and take fewer courses.11. Women are more afraid of contagion (particularly their own contagion or that of their families) and fear the collapse of the health system.  12. People from the middle and working classes, who receive a regular salary, are less than 70 years old, with middle incomes and social security. This group identifies itself with a centre-left or left-wing ideology; strongly approves the mandatory measures adopted by the government and its performance with regard to the pandemic (it should be remembered that the Argentinian government is left-leaning)..13. Among the upper classes, where a right-wing or centre-right ideology predominates, the evaluation of governmental performance is highly critical..14. The social group comprised of unemployed or inactive individuals who belong to the lower classes and do not have social security. This group stays away from political ideology, from evaluating the government or measures of social control..","On 19 March 2020, the Argentinian government declared ‘mandatory preventive social isolation’, which prohibited free movement of people throughout the national territory; only minimum and indispensable trips to get medicine and food were allowed. Essential workers or those who needed to go out for emergency reasons (such as visiting the doctor or assisting older adults) were required to have a special permit; otherwise, severe economic fines would be applied.","1. This main finding is that inequality and social class differences mediate the relationship between secondary risks and confinement.

The mean LSA score before the COVID-19 pandemic was 64.0 (SD 26.0) and mean LSA score since the pandemic was 37.8 (SD 22.1), and the 1 was -26.2 (SD 25.0). A significant reduction was observed in LSA scores from Level 2 up to Level 5 (p < 0.001; see Figure 2 and Table 2)..3. Pardo (mixed race) individuals had a significantly lower LSA score (p < 0.001) before the pandemic compared with white individuals, and this situation persisted since the pandemic (p = 0.005). A smaller, but significant reduction in LSA (delta LSA) (p < 0.001) was observed among pardo individuals compared with white individuals.

This results showed significant changes in life-space mobility, particularly outside of the home environment (in the neighborhood, in the town, and beyond town)..2. Reductions in life-space mobility were higher among older people living alone, those aged between 70 and 79 years compared to older people aged 80 years old and over, and black individuals compared to pardo individuals, exposing underlying inequalities that might have been aggravated by the pandemic..3. They found post-pandemic reductions of around 20 points in LSA scores. A score above 10 points is considered a marker of poor health outcomes.4. The continuous restriction in life-space mobility due to COVID-19 might increase the risk of developing chronic conditions and functional decline..5. They found older adults who were male, who had a moderate to high educational level, and who had a higher income level enjoyed more life-space mobility compared to women, individuals with lower educational and income levels..6. That compared to older women; older men already had greater life-space mobility before the COVID- 19 pandemic. .7. The life-threatening situation of the COVID-19 pandemic might have not alarmed older men. Men were found twice as likely to be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 in all age groups.8. Higher reductions in life-space mobility were observed among black individuals compared to older pardo individuals. Employment inequalities in this population might in part explain this reduction..9. Low socioeconomic status and physical inactivity during the pandemic combined with underlying health conditions that are common in this population may increase the risk of poor management of non-communicable diseases, disability, and frailty..10. This results underline the need to structure urgent comprehensive responses to mitigate pandemic consequences among older adults living alone, among black individuals, and for people with lower income and education levels. Prioritized actions should be set up urgently to assist these vulnerable groups in the community, strengthening existing policies in the public sector, particularly the Family Strategy Program in the National Health Service (or SUS)..11. Innovative digital technologies should be envisioned to scale up best-buy interventions, such as digital platforms to deliver physical activity and rehabilitation programs.12. Social restriction measures due to a pandemic caused substantial limitations in older adults’ life-space mobility in Brazil.

The results indicate the distinct contamination dynamic for Indigenous Peoples when compared to the remaining groups..2. Concerning the total cases in Brazil, it is possible to outline the trajectory of the spread of the disease over time, which has led to almost five million cases by October 1st (see Figure 2A)..3. The Legal Amazon’s tally follows a similar path to Brazil’s, characterized by a sharper initial curve (see Figure 2B). .4. The Indigenous new cases are distinguished by their particular fluctuation (see Figures 2C, and 2D)..5. The data demonstrate that after the curve peaked by the 22nd epidemiological week, the number of deaths per week remained stable, followed by a decrease in the latest weeks examined..6. The graphs for Indigenous deaths exhibit an oscillation in the number of fatalities per week, resembling the values for confirmed cases, as the virus spread throughout the communities (see Figures 3C and 3D)..7. It is noticeable that in the first weeks, COIAB’s tally accounted for a larger amount of deaths caused by coronavirus in comparison with SESAI’s reports, which indicates an expressive under-reporting..8. The incidence rate for Indigenous communities is 106% higher than the Brazilian rate and 48% higher than the one observed in the Legal Amazon..9. The Indigenous mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants, it is 110% higher than the Brazilian average and exceeds the Legal Amazon mortality rate by 89% (see Figures 4B and 5B)..10. According to SESAI's the mortality rate for Indigenous Peoples is lower than the Legal Amazon, and only 3.5% higher than Brazil’s rate. The lethality also indicates a serious under-reporting as SESAI’s values are 51% smaller than COIAB’s numbers (see Figure 4C)..11. Northwest of the Amazonas state, this Sanitary District has twenty-seven ethnical groups, it has the fourth-highest incidence rate and it is first in mortality rate, which got to this level in the first period of contagion due to the contact of an infected health professional with the local communities.12.

It is believed that this unfavorable scenario among black people is due to the difficulty or impossibility of carrying out social isolation, the prevalence of comorbidities that precipitate serious cases of COVID-19, difficulties in accessing health services and institutional racism..4.

The results of this review offer an overview that contradicts the widespread myth about the 'democratic' character of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out the gender and racial inequalities that condition the occurrence of Covid-19 and its implications for compliance with recommended measures for its control..2. In previous epidemics, structural inequities of race and gender and the fragility of health services were neglected. This pattern has been repeated in the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly in Latin American countries, which have not recognized Sexual and Reproductive Health services as essential. Brazil finds itself in a more serious situation, considering the dismantling of health services and the loss of conquered rights, especially sexual and reproductive rights..3. Access and timely care must be guaranteed to parturient women and their newborns, as well as to women suffering from abortion, with precautions taken for their safety. Attention to symptomatic pregnant women for Covid-19 should also be ensured, with guidance to women about referral services..4. During the pandemic, the full performance of care networks for women in situations of violence must be preserved, particularly abortion services in cases provided for by law..5. Intersectional approaches are incipient, and many questions are posed, requiring the construction of a strong research agenda, with an intersectional approach to gender, race and class. In this way, the formulation of policies will be based on scientific knowledge that incorporates human rights – in particular, sexual and reproductive rights – and that meets the needs of the groups most vulnerable to Covid-19 and its consequences.",Góes EF is funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Global Health Research Program (GHRG/16/137/99).

COVID-19 has created a syndemic scenario that is deepening pre-existing structural inequalities for migrants in Latin American countries .2. During the COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity, unemployment, and reduced socioeconomic agency have led to considerable insecurity and anxiety for migrants living in LACs.   .3. The region faces one of the largest mass migrations worldwide; more than 5·5 million refugees and migrants have left Venezuela, 4·6 million of whom now live in the Latin American region. .4. For decades, migration fuelled the economic and cultural development in the region. Today, migration has increasingly become an issue of risk and precarity.  .5. In LACs, migrants face barriers in accessing regular health services due to inadequate information, the absence of culturally appropriate care, or insufficient legal provisions. Additionally, there have been challenges in the prevention of COVID-19 among migrant populations as a result of poor public health communication, reduced access to public health prevention measures, and living or working in conditions where it is difficult to isolate  .6. COVID-19 has reduced human mobility within and across borders. Border closures and changes to migration policy across Latin America interrupted migrants’ movement, leaving thousands stranded across the region. Others were forced to return to the same danger, social exclusion, inadequate health care, and poverty they had fled   .7. Migrants who were trapped in transit, or who were living with undocumented or irregular status, became even more vulnerable to family separation, trafficking, or exploitation",It is not mentioned in this article,"1. However, the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 on migrants and failure of inclusive health policies and systems have revealed the vulnerability of migrants to the consequences of politics designed without considering migration and human mobility in government agendas.   .2.  Explicit commitment from governments to include migrants in all phases of the evolving public health response to COVID-19 is needed. This response must include ensuring access to vaccination and social protection programmes without discrimination and addressing the broader socioeconomic inequalities that affect migrants’ health..3. Sustainable and inclusive approaches to migrant health should go beyond humanitarian response and meet the needs of local and mobile populations alike, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals agenda.",It does not specify,English,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Commentary,0,0
